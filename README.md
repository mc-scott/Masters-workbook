# MRes Marine Biology Intra-individual variation (IIV) Analysis

## Background

This script constitutes the statistical analysis performed as part of my Marine Biology Masters in 2014. I analysed the within-individual behavioural variation shown in the beadlet anemone (*Actinia equina*) subjected to different hunger treatments. It represents my introduction to R and statistical modeling using package `lme4`.
